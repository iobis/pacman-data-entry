### Samples

Add a record for each collected sample and assign a field number. In case of settlement plates, make sure to add a deployment identifier as well. This identifier should be the same for all plates from a single deployment.

### SRA data

Add a record for each BioSample and add the BioSample accession number. BioSamples should be submitted under the PacMAN BioProject at https://dataview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/object/PRJNA741074/.
